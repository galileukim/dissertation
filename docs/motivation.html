<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> Motivation</h1>
<p>In Brazil, and increasingly across the developing world, public services are under the political administration of elected officials. In this section, I present a theoretical model that integrates the calculus of these principals regarding how to manage bureaucracies that deliver public services, mapping out the consequences of these decisions to their political survival and voter welfare. It is a sequential game, in which newly-elected mayors assess the electoral benefits of improving public services while taking into account the political arena they must coopt to get the budget approved.</p>
<p>The starting point of the game is the entry of a newly elected mayor into office.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> In assuming her new role as the executive leader and manager of the local bureaucracy, the mayor knows that government is not an isolated affair. The political turnover in the executive is accompanied by renewal in the local legislature (<em>câmara de vereadores</em>). Some of these city councillors have declared themselves allies in the electoral campaign, composing what is broadly referred to as the government (<em>governo</em>) bench in the legislature. The remaining councillors are either independent or part of the opposition.</p>
<p>As noted by <span class="citation">Couto and Abrucio (<a href="#ref-couto_governando_1995">1995</a>)</span>, and through my qualitative interviews in municipalities of Brazil, a key feature of local politics is the executive-legislative bargaining over public sector jobs. City councillors actively seek to place loyalists within the bureaucracy, while mayors themselves are more hesitant to do so. This is due to a differential accountability between the two actors: while city councillors cater to small constituencies</p>
<div id="institutional-environment" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Institutional environment</h2>
<p>In Brazil, local governments are composed of two branches. One is the executive, headed by the mayor who is elected through a first past the post system. The other, the local legislature, composed of city councillors elected through an open-list proportional representation system. The existence of these two types of political actors, elected through a different set of institutional rules, introduces in itself a divergent set of interests in the political arena. In particular,</p>
</div>
<div id="structure-of-the-game" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Structure of the game:</h2>
<p>In this section, I outline the action space, payoff structure and timing of the game. There are three actors: a mayor <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, a legislative opposition <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span> and representative median voter <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. The goal of the executive is to be reelected into office.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> The opposition can either approve the The voter derives utility from public goods, which is produced by the municipal bureaucracy.</p>
<p>To make analysis tractable and concise, I introduce a set of simplifying assumptions. First, I assume that the voter is sincere, meaning that he only considers his utility when deciding whether to reelect the incumbent. This excludes pivotality concerns and strategic voting from his choice set. Mayors are one of two types: a competent politician who effectively delivers high quality public goods, and an average one, who fails to always hit the mark. Note that this is an informational heuristic. I do not claim there are infallibly competent politicians. The intuition is that voters have beliefs about how competent a politician is (and strictly prefer those), forming their opinions by observing the quality of public goods they observe.</p>
<p>The game is played in two periods. Voter <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> does not observe the amount of patronage handed out by mayor <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> nor her type, but observes and derives utility from the realization of public good quality <span class="math inline">\(\omega_t\)</span>. A central feature in this model is uncertainty in translating bureaucratic quality <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> to public goods provision <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, with high quality public services <span class="math inline">\(\omega_{h}\)</span> produced probabilistically as a function of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. The parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> captures the inverse relation between patronage and state capacity.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> The share of seats held by the opposition, <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, also adversely affects the probability of high quality goods being provided through the exercise of veto power.</p>
<p>The optimal strategy for the voter is to fire politicians when he believes that the incumbent is not a competent type, after observing the quality of first period public good <span class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span>. For the mayor, her strategy is pinned down by the share of patronage which maximizes expected utility from holding onto office, conditional on her type and expected benefits from reelection. Mayor <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> has to offer public sector jobs to coopt the opposition while ensuring that the voter is satisfied enough to reelect her. The executive’s dilemma is how to reconcile the incentive for reelection and the pressure imposed by the opposition.</p>
<p>The timing of the game is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Nature draws the politician’s type.</li>
<li>Politician observes her type and invests in bureaucratic quality <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>.</li>
<li>Nature realizes public good <span class="math inline">\(\omega_1(\theta_1)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Voter observes <span class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span> and casts vote to retain or fire the incumbent.</li>
<li>If incumbent is retained, she sets <span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span> and nature draws <span class="math inline">\(\omega_2(\theta_2)\)</span>. If incumbent is deposed, a challenger takes office, sets <span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span> and the game ends.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="bureaucratic-quality-veto-power-and-public-goods-provision" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Bureaucratic quality, veto power, and public goods provision:</h2>
<p>I model public goods quality as a random variable <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> with two possible states <span class="math inline">\(\omega \in \{\omega_l, \omega_h\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\omega_h&gt;\omega_l\)</span>. The probability of a high quality public good <span class="math inline">\(\omega_h\)</span> is a function of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, a parameter denoting the bureaucratic quality, and <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, the share of seats held by the opposition. Following <span class="citation">Centeno, Kohli, and Yashar (<a href="#ref-centeno_unpacking_2017">2017</a>)</span>, to avoid conceptual stretching I separate state capacity from its output. In this theoretical framework, state capacity is measured by analyzing personnel composition.<a href="#fn48" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a> Additionally, the opposition can exercise veto power, which increases monotonically with their share of seats in the legislative. Formally:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Pr}(\omega=\omega_h) = \frac{1-s\theta}{1+e^{-(10\theta-5)}}\]</span>
The impact of patronage depends on the share of seats controlled by the opposition. When the opposition have no veto power, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(s=0\)</span>, the executive can costlessly improve the quality of the bureaucracy <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>, keeping patronage at a minimum and maximizing the probability of high quality public goods. When the opposition controls a larger share of the legislative chamber, it can effectively block the mayor from enacting her policy agenda, unless given a large share of public sector jobs, thus decreasing <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. This is captured by the term <span class="math inline">\(s\theta\)</span> in the expression above.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-mayor" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> The mayor:</h2>
<p>The mayor’s choice set is the bureaucratic quality parameter <span class="math inline">\(\theta_t\)</span>. As <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> increases - the mayor allocates a smaller proportion of jobs for patronage - the legislative opposition decreases their support for the executive and threatens to exercise veto power. This reduces the likelihood of providing the necessary resources to provide public goods. Adapting <span class="citation">Gailmard and Patty (<a href="#ref-gailmard_slackers_2007">2007</a>)</span>, there are two types of mayors: competent and average. Competent politicians excel in delivering high quality public goods and are rewarded by voters with reelection. Politicians who fail to excel in such provision are average.</p>
<p>The probability of a politician being competent is common knowledge: <span class="math inline">\(\xi \in [0,1]\)</span>. Conversely, the probability of her being average is simply <span class="math inline">\(1 - \xi\)</span>. Both types derive utility from public goods provision <span class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span>, where for simplicity <span class="math inline">\(u(\omega_l)=0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(u(\omega_h) = 1\)</span>. We do not model the decision of the competent mayor: she simply delivers high quality goods and is inevitably reelected. We focus on the interesting case of the normal politician.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
Eu_m \left(\theta_t, s_1 \middle|\lambda \right) &amp;= \textbf{E}(\omega_1) + \delta \text{Pr}(\text{reelection})\left[\psi + \textbf{E}(\omega_2)  \right] \\
&amp;= \frac{1-s_1\theta_1}{1+e^{-(10\theta_1-5)}} + \delta \text{Pr}(\text{reelection})\left[\psi + \frac{1-s_2\theta_2}{1+e^{-(10\theta_2-5)}} \right] \\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>The expression above formalizes the mayor’s dilemma. The probability of reelection decreases with the share of jobs allocated to the opposition, since it lowers the quality of the bureaucracy. but if the mayor fails to appease them through patronage, it is increasingly costly to “govern”. While technocrats are immune to these political pressures, pragmatists ultimately cave in. The price of compromise in a democratic setting is a reduction in state capacity, as executives are forced to allocate positions within the bureaucracy to garner support in the legislative.<a href="#fn49" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref49"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="solving-the-dilemma-compromise" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Solving the dilemma (compromise):</h2>
<p>Mayors solve the the game through backward induction. If the mayor is a technocrat, she simply and effectively delivers, and the voter consumes <span class="math inline">\(\omega_h\)</span>. The average politician myopically maximizes expected utility in the second period.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial Eu_{m}(\theta_1, \theta_2|\lambda = 1, s_2)}{\partial \theta_2} &amp;= 0 \\
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_2} \frac{1-s_2\theta_2}{1+e^{-(10\theta_2-5)}} &amp;= 0 \\
\frac{1}{e^{-(10\theta_2^*-5)}}+10\theta_2^* &amp;= \frac{10}{s_2} - 1\\
\theta_2^* &amp;= \frac{1}{10s_1}\left[10-s_2-\boldsymbol{W}\left(e^{\frac{1}{s_2}-6}\right)\right]
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>The interpretation of this result is straightforward: increases in the legislative share of the opposition reduces incentives to invest in bureaucratic quality.<a href="#fn50" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref50"><sup>50</sup></a> We can visualize how the optimal bureaucratic quality in the second period changes as a function of <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span> by plotting changes in the probability of high quality public goods.</p>
<p><img src="dissertation_files/figure-html/visualization-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>The quality of the bureaucracy <span class="math inline">\(\theta_2\)</span> which maximizes the mayor’s expected utility in the second period is strictly decreasing in <span class="math inline">\(s_2\)</span>, the share of seats controlled by the opposition. As the power of the opposition increases, its ability to veto and punish the mayor for withholding from patronage increases. The greater the threat of veto power, the more concessions politicians need to make in order to deliver high quality public goods <span class="math inline">\(\omega_h\)</span>. Conversely, when the mayor controls the legislative chamber, the benefits of bureaucratic quality are fully internalized and it is in turn maximized. We now turn to the electoral problem faced by the voters.</p>
<!-- ## Opposition's problem: -->
<!-- The opposition decides whether or not to support the mayor's policies, where $a_o=\left\{ 0,1 \right\}$. If the opposition supports the executive, they receive an $\alpha \in [0,1]$ proportion of public sector jobs, a continuum normalized to 1. The concept of a public sector pie stems from interviews with former and current executive secretaries, who describe a "quota" of jobs allocated to the legislative.^[This echoes the concept of islands of excellence described by @geddes_politicians_1994: small pockets of bureaucratic insulation reserved by the executive for core functions such as macroeconomic management. A similar argument is made in @loureiro_burocracia_2010.] If she refuses, the mayor allocates no pork. I apply the Rubinstein bargaining model solution concept (perfect equilibrium) to solve this subgame with minor adaptations.^[@rubinstein_perfect_1982.] -->
<!-- Mayor's and opposition's utilities are identical to the original setup with two players. I conceptualize the bargain over public sectors as a sequence of offers and counter-offers made by the mayor and her legislative opposition. Following @rubinstein_perfect_1982, players differ in $\delta_i$, a parameter capturing their impatience across sequences in the bargaining game. Respectively: -->
<!-- $$u_m = \prod^{T}_{t=1}\delta_m^t\theta_{1|2}$$  -->
<!-- $$u_o = \prod^{T}_{t=1}\delta_i^t\theta_{1|2}$$ -->
<!-- Applying stationarity restrictions and solving for the unique subgame perfect equilibrium, we have: -->

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> State capacity and democratic accountability:</h2>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> denote the median voter in the municipal electorate. Voters derive utility from the quality of public goods at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, with a discount factor <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[u_v(\omega_t) = \omega_1 + \delta \omega_2\]</span></p>
<p>Because voters cannot observe directly the type of the politician nor her hiring decisions, voters update beliefs about the politician’s type after observing first period public goods output. If a voter observes a low public goods quality, he knows with certainty that the incumbent is incompetent, and therefore <span class="math inline">\(\Pr(\text{competent}|\omega_{1l}) = 0\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mu(\omega_1)\)</span> denote voter’s belief that the politician is of a competent type after observing the first period realization of public goods.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu(\omega_h) = \text{Pr}(\text{competent}| \omega_h) = \frac{\xi}{\xi + \text{Pr}(\omega_1|s)(1-\xi)}&gt;\xi\]</span></p>
<p>Note that for any <span class="math inline">\(\omega_h\)</span>, the probability that the incumbent is competent is higher than the probability of a random challenger being so. As a result, whenever the voter observes a high quality output in the first period, the incumbent gets reelected. This simplifies our analysis. After observing the realization of public good quality <span class="math inline">\(\omega_1\)</span>, he retains the incumbent if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\omega_1 = \omega_h\)</span>, and fires her otherwise. The probability of re-election is simply the probability that public goods provided are of high quality. This is conditional on <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>, the amount of investment in state capacity in the first period and <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span>, the opposition share in the first period.<a href="#fn51" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref51"><sup>51</sup></a></p>

<div id="initial-investments-in-state-capacity" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Initial investments in state capacity:</h2>
<p>We turn to the initial decision of the politician. The executive maximizes her expected utility with respect to first term hiring decisions, factoring in the optimal decision and payoff for the second period. To reiterate, the probability of reelection is simply the probability of high quality public goods provision in the first period. Taking the first order condition with respect to <span class="math inline">\(\theta_1\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}

\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>The optimal amount of investment in state capacity in the first term is analogous to the myopic optimization in the second period, weighed by the expected payoff of reelection. The intuition behind this result is straightforward. As politicians value the future term more, they will invest more in state capacity. This is captured by the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>, the former being the discount factor and the latter, office benefits. However, in a clear illustration of the trade-off implied between investing in state capacity and resorting to patronage to ensure legislative support, the dominant effect is imposed by <span class="math inline">\(s_1\)</span>, the share of legislative seats held by the opposition in the first period.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.8</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Decentralizing reforms in Brazil have taken place since the democratic transition in 1988. One of the cornerstones of decentralization was delegating responsibility for public service provision to municipal governments. Today, public educationo of infants from 6 to 14 years of age in Brazil falls primarily under municipal jurisdiction.<a href="#fn52" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> This transfer of responsibility was accompanied by the rapid expansion of a street-level bureaucracy and mid-level management, geared towards providing educational services to students.<a href="#fn53" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> Understanding the characteristics of this bureaucratic network is the main objective of this chapter.</p>
<p>Who are these bureaucrats responsible for delivering public education in municipalities across Brazil? What role do they play in the administration of these services? What are their characteristics, from both a professional standpoint and in terms of quality of services delivered? Leveraging micro-level data and reports generated internally by the Brazilian government, I provide descriptive statistics of over 1 million municipal teachers and school principals spread across the country. I document changes over time, focusing on a set of covariates: work experience, education level, pupil teacher-ratio, among other key indicators of the structure of this educational bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Any story of bureaucracy is incomplete without the politics. As noted by <span class="citation">Eaton and Chambers-Ju (<a href="#ref-eaton_teachers_2014">2014</a>)</span>, educational staff is not impervious to political processes. While not the primary focus of this chapter, I highlight supportive evidence that the management of educational services intersects with electoral cycles. Interviews collected during fieldwork in the state of Ceará in the summers of 2018 and 2019 lend support to the hypothesis that schools and educational staff are subject to intense turnovoer as a result of political administration. I test this more rigorously in the following chapter: turnover.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-depends-on-public-education" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.9</span> Who depends on public education?</h2>
<p>One of the most concerning features of public education in Brazill is that primary education is almost exclusively dependant on municipal governments. Crucial, formative steps in the cognitive development of infants depend on the quality of formal instructioon offered in schools, such as verbal and mathematical literacy. Where that pipeline is broken, school evasion and drop-out are unfortunately common, with often irreversible damage to the educational formation of these children.</p>
<p>As noted before, decentralization has transferred responsibility for the education of students</p>

<p>The empirical analysis of bureaucrats responsible public service delivery is a novel contribution to extant literature on social policy in Latin America. Previous studies have conceptualized social policy primarily from the standpoint of both legislation and clientelistic redistribution.<a href="#fn54" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a> In order to understand access to public services, scholars have analyzed the implementation of progressive social policies to the rise of leftist parties or coalitions in the turn of the 21st century.<a href="#fn55" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Others have criticized this focus on formal institutions, arguing that informal practices such as clientelism undermine the actual implementation of social policy, leading to perverse accountability in some cases.<a href="#fn56" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a></p>
<p>Beyond the formal and informal analysis of social policies, there is the problem of bureaucratic implementation and that is the focus of this chapter.<a href="#fn57" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> For each social policy, the final point of contact connecting the state to citizen is the bureaucrat delivering the relevant service.<a href="#fn58" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> To focus my analysis, I build on extant literature on bureacracies in Latin America and Brazil in particular.<a href="#fn59" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></p>
<p>Studies on bureaucracies in Latin American countries have primarily narrowed in on technocratic upper echelons, the commanding heights of the state such as federal-level bureaucrats responsible for determining macroeconomic policy or technological innovation.<a href="#fn60" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> Limited focus has been placed on the bureaucratic staff at the municipal level, and even less so at teachers or doctors responsible for delivering these services on the ground.<a href="#fn61" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>
<p>Making precise the object of inquiry requires delving deeper into the structure of educational services in Brazil. This chapter provides an outline of the governmental structure of responsibility for education, as well as the degree of interaction between different levels of government. Moreover, I trace the educational system at the municipal level and myriad evolution paths across time from the standpoint of the personnel. I highlight the historical trends in the quality of educational staff, while also pinpointing the wide heterogeneities which persist. In doing so, I draw inspiration from <span class="citation">Arretche (<a href="#ref-arretche_trajetorias_2015">2015</a>)</span>, which documents the recent changes in social policy, citing significant improvements in educational outcomes. My focus is on the historical evolution of the municipal education system, from primarily a spatial and temporal perspective.</p>
<p>The chapter is divided into four sections. The first traces an institutional and organizational history of educational services in Brazil from the municipal level, focusing particularly on the consequences of decentralization on the growth of the educational bureaucracy. The second section focuses on personnel, describing the evolution of educational staff, shedding light on the professional characteristics of teachers and school principals from a nation-wide, municipal perspective. This contrasts with more anecdotal analyses of local educational systems, such as <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="abrucio_gestao_2010"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.<a href="#fn62" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<p>The third section lays out the framework for linking educational staff to the electoral cycle. I describe how cycles of brueaucratic turnover align with the electoral calendar, raising concerns as to the degree of alignment between political interests over patronage and personnel management. Estimates of the relationship between is to be found in the executive decisions made by mayors who are elected into office since they have sole jurisdiction over educational policy. This research agenda will be the subject of the next iteration in this research project.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-changing-educational-landscape" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.10</span> A changing educational landscape</h2>
<p>In Brazil, the responsibility for primary education, in the formative years from 6 to 14, were historically the responsibility of states, not municipalities. Due to demographic changes, this student body has been declining across most of the regions in Brazil, with the exception of the Northeast. Accompanying these changes is the relocation of the majority of these students under the purveyal of municipal governments, responsible for administering educational services to this growing</p>
<p>In this analysis, I focus on the teachers responsible for primary education, the equivalent to kindergarten through eight grade in the United States. These are formative years, where students from 6 to 14 years old learn crucial skills such as counting, reading and writing. Since democratization in 1988, the new constitution enshrined primary education as the responsibility of municipal governments. Since then, Brazil’s education system has rapidly expanded, with a massive growth in the number of municipal teachers. The dashed lines denote municipal election years.</p>
<p>There has been widespread debate on the potential for patronage by local politicians.<a href="#fn63" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a> It is important, however, not to assume that patronage is the only mode of hiring at the local level.<a href="#fn64" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> To assess whether or not these new teachers are being hired meritocratically or through patronage, we must know who they are. A major contribution of our empirical analysis is leveraging the fine-grained data of the RAIS (Annual Report of Social Information), a micro-level data set collected annually by the Ministry of Labor. We go beyond raw numbers to illuminating teachers’ characteristics.<a href="#fn65" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>This section sheds light on who decides to become a teacher in municipalities across Brazil. Teachers tend to be relatively older professionals, with a historically weak educational background. This trend, however, has been shifting over time. While in 1985, only 15 percent had a higher education degree, in 2015 over 60 percent had at least completed university. Figure 2 illustrates this shift across different sectors.</p>
<p><img src="dissertation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In fact, it is important to note that despite pessimistic evaluations of the quality of education in Brazil, there has been significant improvements occurring throughout the years. While the public sector lags behind the private in terms of educational background of its teaching personnel, there has been significant improvements over time. More than half of its staff hold higher education degrees.</p>
<p>These improvements have been accompanied by better compensation for public teachers. While in the early 1990’s, private teachers received higher wages than their public counterparts, this changed by the 2000’s. Currently, the median wage for a public sector teacher stands at around 970 reais (270 US dollars), far more than the median private teacher wage, 575 reais (160 US dollars).</p>
<p><img src="dissertation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<p>There has been a steady improvement in the overall professional experience of teachers. The median professional experience of the private sector has remained stable at around 2.5 years, while for the public sector it has increased to over 7 years in 2015. This confirms popular opinion of public sector teaching jobs as inherently more stable than their private counterparts.</p>
<p><img src="dissertation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><img src="dissertation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<p>Finally, the proportion of teachers who are offered a permanent contract has decreased dramatically since 2002. There is also an increase in the turnover rate, a natural development given the lower job security offered by temporary contracts. Figures 5 and 6 illustrate these changes. This development raises concerns over the level of expertise which these teachers can develop given such high attrition through different administrations.<a href="#fn66" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> Furthermore, social ties with the community are important, a process which naturally takes time and may be more difficult to accomplish when contracts are temporary.</p>
<p><img src="dissertation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="768" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>


<p>There is extensive argument and criticism of the Brazilian bureaucracy as overstaffed, overpaid and incompetent.<a href="#fn67" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> Bureaucrats are either hired through clientelistic practices or, once hired, choose not to exert any effort.<a href="#fn68" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> We often assume that public sector hiring is evidence of patronage, without inquiring who precisely is entering the cadres of our public service.</p>
<p>The data presented in this chapter seeks to redress some of these common perceptions. Despite widespread criticism, there is evidence of significant improvements in the teaching staff, albeit with a large variation across municipalities. It is erroneous to uniformly critique Brazil for its educational failures. The truth is, there are some municipalities which have improved their educational staff while others have failed to do so.</p>

<p>We provide a spatial visualization of three major changes in teaching personnel in the past two decades. The first is with regard to the educational formation of teachers. In 1996, the new Law of Basic Education Principles (<em>Lei de Diretrizes da Educação Básica</em>) stipulated that teachers from lower to middle school were legally mandated to have a higher education degree. A 10-year buffer was given.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, at first very few municipalities obeyed the law. As time progressed, however, we see an increase in the number of teachers who hold a higher education degree. This development is accompanied by a decrease in the number of teachers who have at most completed middle school. This is an important change: because of the ceiling effect in terms of education, other regions such as the Northeast and the North have caught up with their more developed neighbors to the south.</p>
<p>Figure 7 illustrates these changes. The proportion of teachers who have received a higher education degree has increased in a significant proportion of the country, spreading at first in the Southeastern region but later spreading along the North and Northeastern corridor. There still remain areas which are staffed by a large proportion of teachers who have not completed college.</p>

<p>The second empirical finding relates to the attrition rate of teachers, measured as the teacher’s average years working at the municipality. Figure 8 highlights these changes spatially. The northeast and the south are notable for having a more stable personnel, as compared to other regions in Brazil. In particular, coastal areas - which tend to be more densely populated - have a lower attrition rate.</p>
<p>This may be a reflection of the rapid expansion of the educational system in less developed municipalities. Given the need to fill out positions, it may be necessary to recruit new teachers, which necessarily brings down the average years of work in the municipality. Of course, this may be accompanied by job instability, with municipalities firing teachers at a high rate, which may have negative repercussions for students’ educational performance.<a href="#fn69" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a></p>

<p>In Brazil, there are primarily two ways through which teachers get hired. The first one is through a public examination (<em>edital</em>) and offering of a permanent contract after a two-year examination, the statutary (<em>estatutário</em>) regime. The second is through temporary contracts, with no job security guarantee. Although the law stipulates that all teachers must pass a public exam, it does not guarantee permanent employment, being that decision relegated to local governments.</p>
<p>This development merits further inquiry. On the one hand, some scholars have argued that career security is an important requirement for the acquisition of expertise by bureaucrats.<a href="#fn70" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> On the other, scholars have argued that one of the reasons for bureaucracies’ inefficiency was precisely that rigidity and lack of sanctioning of non-performing staff through firing.<a href="#fn71" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>
<p>The third and final empirical finding is with regard to the evolution of wages. As noted above, the past decades have seen a significant increase in the salaries of teachers. Mapping this across municipalities show that this improvement has been widespread throughout the national territory. While in the early 2000’s, most of the high-paying municipalities were concentrated in the south and southeast, there has been a wage increase in other regions as well.</p>

<p>In sum, the empirical evidence presented in these sections demonstrate that there have been widespread improvements in the educational staff in Brazil. Despite criticisms of an ineffective education system, it is clear that the educational staff is better educated and paid than in any other period in history. The question is then why do we still observe such lackluster educational outcomes. Some of the answers may be found in the poor state of our education infrastructure. This is the focus of our next section.</p>


<p>In this section, we delve into Brazil’s educational infrastructure. Using data from the School Census (<em>Censo Escolar</em>), we present an overview of the changes that have occurred in school infrastructure over the last two decades, focusing primarily on municipal schools.</p>
<p>The School Census has been conducted since 1995, on an annual basis, by the Ministry of Education (MEC) and it is the most important source of information about basic education (primary and secondary education) in Brazil. The amount of information collected by the School Census increased dramatically over the years and this can be perceived by the changes in the structure of the data collected.</p>
<p>Between 1995 and 2006, the unit of analysis of the School Census was “schools”. After 2007, the information collected expanded and MEC disaggregated the data into four datasets: schools, classrooms, teachers and enrollment. Each contains a different unit of analysis, that reflects their content (in the case of the enrollment dataset, the student is the unit of analysis).</p>
<p>The importance of understanding the changes in the education infrastructure is related to the impact it can have over student performance and attendance.<a href="#fn72" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> Therefore, not only teaching personnel, as described in previous sections, but also the school’s conditions can affect the overall educational performance of students.</p>
<p>The next sections discuss this issue on two main fronts: the gap between private and municipal schools; and the gap in the school’s infrastructure by region. We identify a catch-up effect of municipal schools with regard to the private sector. Also, despite recent developments, regional discrepancies remain striking. The Northeast and North regions – known to be the poorest administrative regions in Brazil, also have the worst conditions of school infrastructure.</p>

<p>As previously discussed, the general perception in Brazil is that economic inequality promotes the creation of a few private elite education institutions amidst an underfunded and crowded public education system. This impression is largely correct as Figures 10 and 11 show, both in terms of the size of the public sector, but also in probabilistic terms, as it is more unlikely for a student to be in the private sector. Moreover, given that the current Brazilian Constitution delegates basic education to municipalities, we include only private primary and secondary schools.<a href="#fn73" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>

<p>In this sense, Figure 10 compares the size of municipal and private sectors as the number of primary and secondary schools. Surprisingly, the number of municipal schools is decreasing. It is necessary to analyze more carefully the data, but we conjecture that this phenomenon is related to a population decline and, hence to a drop in enrollments, rather than a decrease in funding or poor management of the public sector.<a href="#fn74" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p>Finally, Figure 11 also corroborates the widespread perception in Brazil that private education is the privilege of a few. Between 1995 and 2016, the median probability of a student attending a private school is 5%. This scenario did not change much even during Lula’s government (2003-2010), period in which Brazil experienced an economic boom and upward social mobility.</p>
<p>Figures 10 and 11 confirm that most children and teenagers in Brazil continue to attend municipal schools. The problem is that most of these students attend schools that are far inferior to their private counterpart with respect to their infrastructure. Municipal schools are less likely to have access to internet, computer, running water, among other deficiencies. This is the core debate of the next section.</p>

<p>Using data from School Census, we find enormous gaps between private and public schools different, especially in terms of infrastructure. Nonetheless, municipal schools have improved dramatically over the last two decades. We design a two-fold comparison. The first focuses on basic services, such as clean water and restrooms, and the second on the availability of assets per student: teacher, computer and internet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, deficient services provision distinguish private from municipal schools. Figures 12 and 13 reveal a dismal scenario, of poor access to tap water and inexistence of restrooms in municipal schools. For example, in 2016 the median municipality had 75% of its schools with access to tap water, while for private schools the median was 100% since 1995. Still, between 1997 and 2016, tap water access in municipal schools more than tripled and this trend continues.</p>
<p>Regarding existence of restrooms in municipal schools, the results are more positive, though not perfect. In 1997, the median municipality had just over 75 percent schools with restrooms inside their building. The median reached the mark of 100 percent in 2005, but there are still some municipalities in Brazil without any restrooms in their schools. Meanwhile, the data from the private schools show that since 1997 just some outliers did not have restrooms. The vast majority of private schools have restrooms inside their building since the beginning of the School Census.</p>


<p>Moving on to the second set of comparison, the availability of teachers and computers per student show a continuous improvement in the municipal public schools. Indeed, during the entire period, private schools have outperformed: more teachers and more computer per student. Nonetheless, the effort to improve municipal schools can be seen in Figure 14 and Figure 15. Both Figures highlight the steady increase on the investments in human resources and in computers done by municipal schools in Brazil.</p>


<p>We provide data on internet access by sector in Figure 16. The data reveal that even the private schools struggled to have a median of 100 percent. In contrast, municipal schools are close to a median of 75 percent in 2016, in spite of a boost in the probability of having internet access between 2010 and 2011.
<!-- ^[Figure 16 show a spike in the probability of municipal schools to have internet access between 2005 and 2006. During these two years, School Census changed the question and, instead of the affirmative version, asked if the school did not have internet access. Our coding reflected the change done by the Census, but for municipal schools the data is still discrepant.]  --></p>

<p>Usually in the developed world, internet is an elementary part of the educational system. Teachers use the web to enrich classroom material and students are encouraged to do online research. Until 2010, half of the municipalities had at most a quarter of their schools with internet access. In 2016, this improves to three quarters of schools with internet access.</p>
<p>However, as we are going to explore in the next section, this improvement was not uniform. Some municipalities had a faster and/or a better development over the period than others. Therefore, the focus of the next section is to unveil these differences among municipal public sectors.</p>

<p>Brazil is characterized by wide interregional differences. These span economic development, infrastructure, and, of course, education. In this section we provide a visualization of these regional inequalities. These maps allow us to see the extent of the gap which persist between education systems across the national territory. We focus on two variables: internet access and PTR (pupil to teacher ratio).</p>
<p>Figure 17 and 18 reveal that between 2000 and 2015, the vast majority of Brazilian municipalities saw an improvement both in terms of internet access and PTR. Nevertheless, the disparity between regions is remarkable and persist over time.<a href="#fn75" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a> Municipal public schools in the Northeast and North are in far worse shape than in other regions.</p>
<p>The difference between regions reflects a broader socio-economic difference between Brazilian regions. Nonetheless, what these maps highlight is that even within regions there are municipalities that have a good quality of infrastructure and investment in personnel when comparing to its neighbors. These “islands of excellence” will be the main focus of our future research agenda. The question is what explains these outcomes.</p>



<p>This study sheds light on Brazil’s educational system, focusing on both its personnel and infrastructure. There are two major gaps that structure our analysis: private-public and public-public. Unsurprisingly, the private-public is enormous: internet adoption, PTR, education level of teachers, computers, restrooms, among others, are far superior in the private sector.</p>
<p>Despite this, there have been improvements in the public sector, a catch-up effect that has occurred primarily in the last decade. This is a result of greater investment in education as a result of the commodity boom, and the enshrinement of education as a budgetary priority which occurred in the last governments.</p>
<p>The other gap is the public-public. We outline regional inequalities in educational infrastructure and personnel, while being cognizant that these wide brushstrokes obscure intraregional differences. The existence of “islands of excellence” needs to be explained, systematically and theory driven. Good government in the tropics, as outlined by Tendler, should not be an exceptional case: it needs to be explained.<a href="#fn76" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a></p>
<p>In Brazil’s scholarly community, there have been widespread debates on the successful case of Sobral, in the state of Ceará. It is a municipality located in one of the poorest states, yet it was able to invest in its educational system and had positive results in student performance. However, the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is 1: how exceptional is Sobral really? Is it possible that other municipalities have followed a similar trajectory of improvement? And why?</p>
<p>This is what motivates the next step in our project, which is to provide a theoretical framework to explain these changes. Investments in education cannot be explained solely by path dependence: there is room for agency. With the sea of data available to us, researchers, there can be multiple Sobral’s which emerge across Brazil. Treating them systematically, understanding how and why these occur will be the next iteration of our research agenda.</p>
