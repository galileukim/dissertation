# An illustration

![President Temer and Chief of Staff Ronaldo Fonseca](temer_coalition.jpg){width=300px}

# An illustration
* President Temer needs legislative support.
    * Appoints congressman Fonseca as Chief of Staff.
    * Leader of the evangelical bench.
* Minister Fonseca reshuffles the ministry.
    * Replaces former managers with network of followers.
    * Lawyer replaced by theologian as the presidency's ombudswoman.
* Loss of state capacity.
    * "Since then, Fonseca has had difficulties managing civil servants and [...] projects requiring his approval have slowed down." (**Folha de SÃ£o Paulo**)

# Motivation
* Bureaucratic reshuffling is a political choice.
    * Affects quality of civil service.
* It is costly.
    * Executives balance the need for legislative support with loss of state capacity.
* This is not an isolated event.
    * Each mayor in Brazil plays a similar game.

# Research question
* Under what conditions do executive leaders invest in state capacity? How does electoral accountability structure the executive trade-off between legislative support and the decision to reshuffle bureaucracies?

# Main findings
* A stronger opposition is linked to increases in cabinet reshuffling.
    * Proportion of newcomers.
    * Firing.
    * Career servants.

# Overview
* Literature review.
* Theoretical model.
* Case and data.
* Empirical findings.
* Conclusion and next steps.

# State capacity
* Breaking down state capacity.
    * Fiscal capacity. \textcolor{black!25}{\footnotesize(Pardelli 2018, Centeno 1997)}
    * Infrastructural power. \textcolor{black!25}{\footnotesize(Soifer 2008.)}
* Bureaucratic cohesion.
    * The degree to which bureaucracies are stable across administrations.\textcolor{black!25}{\footnotesize\footnotesize(Kohli 2004, Evans 1995, Evans and Rauch 1999)}
    
# Historical institutionalism
* What explains variation in state capacity?
    * Institutional legacy $\rightarrow$ contemporary state capacity.
* Colonial legacy.\source{(Acemoglu and Robinson 2001, Mahoney 2010)}
    * Colonial elites underinvest in administrative institutions.\source{(Kurtz 2013)}
* Bureaucratic institutional reforms.
    * Civil service laws barred from enactment.\source{(Grindle 2012, Evans 1995)}
    * Bureaucracies exposed to political intervention.\source{(Nunes 1997, Evans and Rauch 1999)}

# Theoretical gaps
* Intertemporal variation.
    * State capacity changes over time, depends on executive leadership.\source{(Geddes 1994)}
* Agency-based, localized approach.
    * Decentralization and the rise of local actors.\source{(Falleti 2010, O'Neill 2005)}
    * Electoral accountability and interaction between executive leaders and legislators.

# Patronage and presidential coalitionism
* Public sector jobs are politically valuable.
    * Secure support from followers and politicize public services.\source{(Colonnelli et al. 2017, Oliveros 2016)}
* Presidential coalitionism.
    * Executive leaders give jobs in exchange for legislative support.\source{(Figueiredo and Limongi 2012, Neto 2006)}
    * Protect key positions from political appointments.\source{(Loureiro and Abrucio 1999)}

# The executive dilemma
* Mayors are career oriented and value reelection.
    * Electoral accountability.\source{(Ferejohn 1986, Coate and Morris 1995.)}
* Public goods a probabilistic outcome of state capacity.
    * Reduced when executive engages in patronage.
    * Depends on budgetary approval by the legislative.

# Timing of the game.
1. Nature draws the politician's type (competent or not) and opposition's legislative share $s_1$.
2. Politician observes her type and invests in bureaucratic quality $\theta_1$.
3. Realization of public good $\omega_1(\theta_1, s_1)$.
4. Voter observes $\omega_1$ and votes to retain or fire the incumbent.
5.
    a. If incumbent is retained, she sets $\theta_2$ and nature draws $\omega_2(\theta_2)$.
    b. If incumbent is fired,  challenger sets $\theta_2$ and the game ends.

# The executive dilemma
* Bureaucratic turnover poses a dilemma.
    * Decreases the probability of reelection.
    * Facilitates cooperation by the legislative opposition.
* Main proposition.
    * Increases in the opposition share of the legislative reduce executive incentives for investing in bureaucratic quality.

# The case and data
* Brazilian municipalities and politicians (TSE).
    * 5,500 mayors and 50,000 local legislators.
    * 3 electoral cycles.
* Municipal bureaucracies (RAIS).
    * 750,000 bureaucrats per year (2005-2015).
    * Access to micro-level information on bureaucrats.
* Other data.
    * Campaign contributions (TSE).
    * Municipal demographic data (IBGE) and budget (FINBRA).
    
# Government structure and local bureaucracies
* Hiring decisions are under executive jurisdiction.
    * Mayors have exclusive prerogative over who to hire or dismiss.
* Budgetary approval conditional on legislative support.
    * Ultimately, legislators must approve the local budget.
* Bureaucracy embedded in an executive-legislative political game.

# Empirical test
* Two specifications, focus on cabinet members.
    * Micro-level and municipal level aggregation.
    * Three outcomes: newcomer, fired, career servants.
    * Main predictor: share of legislative seats held by the opposition. 
* Logistic regression.
$$\text{logit}(Y_{ijt}) = \alpha_{st} + \gamma\text{Opposition Share}_{jt} + \beta X_{ijt} + \xi W_{jt}+ \epsilon_{ijt}$$
* Fixed effects  regression.
$$y_{jst} = \alpha_s + \delta_t + \gamma\text{Opposition Share}_{jt}  +\xi W_{jt} + \epsilon_{jt}$$

# Conclusion and next steps:
* Executive-legislative relations explains variation in cabinet turnover.
    * Political calculus underlying bureaucratic reshuffling decisions.
* Electoral accountability and veto power.
    * Hiring principals do not fully internalize the benefits of higher state capacity.

# Next steps:
* The search for an instrument continues. 
* Probabilistic match of bureaucrats to partisan affilliation.
    * Unpack which parties receive patronage.
* Expand analysis to different branches of bureaucracies.
    * Particular focus on education.
* Link bureaucratic turnover to welfare outcomes.
    * Preliminary results suggest staff reshuffling reduce student educational performance.
