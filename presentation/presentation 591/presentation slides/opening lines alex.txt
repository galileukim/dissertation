This is where it all began.
Let me explain the context of this picture.
It was November 2013. My first fieldwork experience in the poorest state of Peru: Huancavelica, up in the Andes.
As I visited each municipality, I had the opportunity to interview local mayors.
I always asked them one question: what is the greatest challenge that you have faced in your administration?
A common theme emerged: staffing. Different mayors outlined their difficulties hiring college-educated bureaucrats, 
who they called "profesionales".
But this is not a story only about Peru. In fact, the research I am going to present today is on Brazil, 
and decentralization is a global phenomenon.
Understanding what kind of bureaucrats staff these local governments, and why do mayors decide to invest in 
professionalizing their bureaucracies is paramount if decentralization is to deliver welfare to the broader population.

Here is an outline of my presentation.

First, I will address the broader theoretical debate on state capacity and how to conceptualize it.
Second, I will outline why we should look at local bureaucracies and explore this data in the Brazilian context.
Third, I will propose an estimation strategy for measuring the effect of programmatic mayors on local bureaucracies.

State capacity is a multidimensional concept.
Some scholars ahae highlighted extractive capacity. Others, the infrastructural power, or territorial reach of the state.
I focus on administrative capacity, measuring it by the educational levels of bureaucrats at the municipal level.
